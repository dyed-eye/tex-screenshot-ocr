# tex-screenshot-ocr

Simple python app to fetch screenshots and recognize TeX math expressions inside

To start simply open your Command Prompt (`Win+R`, `cmd`) and paste:

`pip intall pywin32 keyboard pythonwx pyscreenshot pix2tex`

and then

`py main.py`

in the root folder.

Currently works for windows. The first use might take more time than you expect. Or much more.
